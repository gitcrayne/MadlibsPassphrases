The program uses multiple text files that hold word lists, proper names, and a list of common passwords. Any of these text files can be edited, but care should be taken when editing word lists. As there is lists for proper names, plural nouns, and both plural and singular verbs, adding words that do not meet the criteria of the list could cause poor results when the program is generating passphrases.
